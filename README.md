This is the first group project for the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Flex Web Development bootcamp.

Group Name: getH.API

Group Members:
* Corey Parker
* Damian Grace
* Meredith Wall
* Shelley McHardey
* Terrell Morris
## Description
This project was completed after learning Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web APIs, Third Party APIs, and Server Side APIs. 

The project objective was to work with a group to create a real-world front-end application that we will be able to showcase to potential future employers.

The following acceptance criteria were used in the development of this project and web application:

* Application uses at least two server-side APIs

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
## User Story

* WHEN a user needs a quick pick-me-up,
* THEN the application provides a pick-me-up in the form of a random fact, dad joke, or inspiring quote for the user.
* WHEN a user opens the application,
* THEN they are presented with the option to either get a random pick-me-up OR select options for some knowledge (a random fact), some laughter (a dad joke), or some inspiration (an inspirational quote).
* WHEN a user chooses the 'Surprise Me' option,
* THEN they are presented with a randomly generated fact, dad joke, or inspirational quote.
* WHEN a user chooses the 'I need...' option,
* THEN they are presented with options for 'some knowledge', 'some laughter', or 'some inspiration'.
* WHEN a user chooses that they need 'some knowledge', 
* THEN they are presented with a randomly generated fun fact.
* WHEN a user chooses that they need 'some laughter', 
* THEN they are presented with a randomly generated dad joke.
* WHEN a user chooses that they need 'some inspiration', 
* THEN they are presented with a randomly generated inspirational quote.
* WHEN a user is presented with their pick-me-up,
* THEN they are presented with an input field to rate the pick-me-up from 1 to 5.
* WHEN a user submits their rating for their pick-me-up,
* THEN their pick-me-up and rating is saved to local storage.
* WHEN a user loads the application or submits a rating for their pick-me-up,
* THEN they are presented with a sorted list of their top 5 rated previous pick-me-ups with associated ratings in the 'Your Favorites' section of the UI.
* WHEN a user has less than 5 previous pick-me-ups, 
* THEN they are presented with as many previous pick-me-ups with associated ratings as are stored on their local storage.
